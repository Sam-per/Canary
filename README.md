## Installation

If you wish to use the `update` command to update to the latest version of the bot, configure your github account in 
your environment of choice and clone into the repository with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/idoneam/Canary
```

Dependencies are managed with pipenv which can be installed via pip with:
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install pipenv
```

Dependencies may be installed using pipenv with the following command:
```bash
$ pipenv install
```

Development dependencies (YAPF) can be installed alongside all other dependencies with:
```bash
$ pipenv install --dev
```

You may enter the virtual environment generated by the pipenv installation with:
```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

Or simply run the bot with:
```bash
$ pipenv run python3 Main.py
```

In order to run bots on Discord, you need to [create a bot account](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

You must set certain values in the `config.ini` file, in particular your Discord bot token (which you get in the previous link) and the values in the `[Server]` section.
<details><summary>Click here to see descriptions for a few of those values</summary><p>
 
(For values that use Discord IDs, see [this](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) to know how to find them)
* `[Discord]`
    * `Key`: Your Discord bot token.
* `[Server]`
    * `ServerID`: Your server ID.
    * `CommandPrefix`: What a message should begin with to be considered a command.
    * `BotName`: The name of your bot.
    * `UpvoteEmoji`: The name of your upvote emoji (for the score function).
    * `DownvoteEmoji`: The name of your downvote emoji.
    * `ModeratorRole`: The name of the role that your moderators have (for functions like DMing users).
    * `DeveloperRole`: The name of the role that your developers have (for functions like restarting the bot). This could be the same role than moderator.
    * `ReceptionChannelID`: The ID of a channel that will receive messages sent to the bot through the `answer` command (and where messages sent by mods to users with the `dm` command will be logged)
* `[Logging]`
    * `LogLevel`: [See this for a list of levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels). Logs from exceptions and commands like `mix` and `bac` are at the `info` level. Logging messages from the level selected *and* from more severe levels will be sent to your logging file. For example, setting the level to `info` also sends logs from `warning`, `error` and `critical`, but not  from `debug`.
    * `LogFile`: The file where the logging output will be sent (will be created there by the bot if it doesn't exist).
* `[DB]`
    * `Schema`: Location of the Schema file that creates tables in the database (This file already exists so you shouldn't have to change this unless you rename it or change its location).
    * `Path`: Your database file path (will be created there by the bot if it doesn't exist).
* `[Currency]`
    * `Name`: The name of the bot currency.
    * `Symbol`: The currency's symbol (e.g. `$`).
    * `Precision`: How many decimal digits after the decimal point are "official" for the currency.
    * `Initial`: How much currency is given out by the `initial_claim` command.
    * `SalaryBase`: *Currently unused.*
    * `Inflation`: *Currently unused.*
* `[IncomeTax]`: *Currently unused.*
* `[AssetTax]`: *Currently unused.*
* `[OtherTax]`: *Currently unused.*
* `[Betting]`:
    * `RollCases`: Intervals for `bet_roll`. For example, a value of `66, 90, 99, 100` gives the intervals
      `[1, 66]`, `[67, 90]`, `[91, 99]`, and `[100]`.
    * `RollReturns`: The multiplier return for each interval. For example, a value of `0, 2, 4, 10` with the intervals
      described above gives a 0x return for `random <= 66`, a 2x return for `66 < random <= 90`, a 4x return for
      `90 < random <= 99`, and a 10x return for `random == 100`.

## Running the bot
Run `python3 Main.py` in your shell. Ensure that your Discord token is set in the `config.ini` file within the `config` directory.

## Code Linting
We format our code using Google's [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf). Our builds will reject code that do not conform to the standards defined in [`.style.yapf`](https://github.com/idoneam/Canary/blob/master/.style.yapf) . You may format your code using :

```
$ yapf --recursive --in-place .
```
and ensure your code conforms to our linting with :
```
$ yapf --diff --recursive .
```
