# Canary
Python3 Discord bot.

## Installation

Install dependencies with `python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt`. If you'd like to learn more about them, dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` - you can search for them in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org).

In order to run bots on Discord, you need to [create a bot account](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

Set your Discord bot token in the `config.ini` file within the `config` directory. Also change your Database file path as well as Greeting and Farewell messages, if desired.

## Running the bot
Run `python3 Main.py` in your shell. Ensure that your Discord token is set in the `config.ini` file within the `config` directory.
